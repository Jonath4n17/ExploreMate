# ExploreMate
This was a passion project to teach myself Swift and learn iOS development. More than often, I find myself unsure of what to do or where to eat. This app solves this issue by allowing users to discover nearby activities and restaurants through
an engaging, swipe-based user interface. This project was built using only Swift following the MVVM design pattern with an API service layer connected to Google Places API to retrieve information.  :technologist:	

So far, this project is just an early prototype of the end app I had in mind. I intend to finish the lists tab to view liked locations, implement a recommendation system using possibly AI or an assigned weight algorithm, and allow for different users to connect with each
other and to determine activties that they have all swiped right on.
